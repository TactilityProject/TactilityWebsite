# M5Stack Tab5

⚠️ Only the original type is supported for now ⚠️ 

The original Tab5 hardware revision was discontinued about 2 months after release on October 14th 2025:

> [...] the original independent display driver ILI9881C and touch driver GT911 have been replaced

New units will currently not work yet with Tactility as the display and touch drivers are not compatible.
I intend to support the new hardware in the future.
