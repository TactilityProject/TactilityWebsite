# Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 v3

⚠️ This device implementation is incubating

⚠️ There is an issue with the display driver, which causes pixels to be cut off on the right-side of the screen, and renders them on the next row.

⚠️ The WebServer app starts, but it's not possible to see the password.

Because the device has very limited user input capabilities, it launches the web server application by default. The plan is to eventually enable navigation through the interface using its physical buttons.
